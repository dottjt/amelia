The Tales of Amelia Snow

### Was Amelia Snow an actual person?

Yes and no. I'm almost 100% certain her name wasn't actually Amelia Snow, and I myself am not sure how much of that person was genuine, and not some big character. All I truly know is that she was actual person in the physical sense and that I got to experience parts of her life. Maybe it was autism. Maybe she was an incredible actor. I would argue it was both, either intentionally or unintentionally. 

Apparently she should also be dead, although that may not be true and there would be no way for me to confirm that anyway.

Much like my prior novel and its loose relation to my own character, this book is also only loosely tied to her. Nearly all of it is fabricated.

### Understanding Narrative. 

One thing which I try to do with my novels is that I want to be able to tell a narrative through the book. As in, the narrative is the life of the character. Which is to say that Amelia isn't a person within the novel. Amelia is merely an idea within the novel which transcends the physicality of what it means to be human. She is nothing more than a narrative, and I really want to push that idea. As if the author is actually the father of her creation. 

Which is to say that Amelia in a lot of ways is just a puppet. A puppet for the author to organise, dictate and 

The ramblings of a writer.
