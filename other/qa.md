The Tales of Amelia Snow

### Was Amelia Snow an actual person?

Yes and no. I'm almost 100% certain her name wasn't actually Amelia Snow, and I myself am not sure how much of that person was genuine. All I truly know is that she was actual person in the physical sense and that I got to experience parts of her life.

Apparently she should also be dead, although that may not be true and there would be no way for me to confirm that anyway.

Much like my prior novel and its loose relation to my own character, this book is also only loosely tied to her. Nearly all of it is fabricated.
