09/05/2020 - I had the idea of maybe writing a novel about Amelia, from her 1st person point of view. The first scene came to me when I was awake at 2:30am after coming back from the bathroom and being unable to sleep. Today I thought I'd create a repository for it. Could be interesting, who knows.
