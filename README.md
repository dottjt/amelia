# The Tales of Amelia Snow

The Tales of Amelia Snow is my second novel.

I have doubts my first novel will find a publisher, given the graphic nature of it. So I thought maybe I'd write something I little more considered. Although knowing me, I'll find a way to make it graphic. Also, it's just a bit of variety, so I can jump projects if I get mentally stuck on either.

It presents in first-person the thoughts and narratives of Amelia Snow. She is autistic and the premise of the novel is that she knows nothing about the world, and we observe her attempt to adapt to it. There's a lot of different ways I can 

I want maybe the first portion to explore her childhood, then for the novel to organically transition into her adulthood.

At best it's a disingenuous attempt at lore, but that's always what my writing has been. A cerebal exaggeration extending male fantasy well beyond which it should be conceived. The words are not real, so let's leave them that way.
