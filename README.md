# The Tales of Amelia Snow

The Tales of Amelia Snow is my second novel.

It presents the memories of Amelia Snow told in first-person. She is autistic and the premise of the novel is that she knows nothing about the world, and we observe her attempt to adapt to it. There's a lot of different ways I can play this out, I am still in a brain storming phase. 

I want maybe the first portion to explore her childhood, then for the novel to organically transition into her adulthood.

At best it's a disingenuous attempt at lore, but that's always what my writing has been. A cerebal exaggeration extending male fantasy well beyond which it should be conceived. The words are not real, so let's leave them that way.

The novel is a bit like Pan's Labrinth. It might also have been her favourite film.
